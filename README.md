# Sancho's Irish Tacos üåÆ ‚òòÔ∏è

A Python project demonstrating the use of Pydantic AI and Anthropic Claude models for various AI-powered applications.

## Project Overview

Despite its playful name, this project is not about food! It's actually a demonstration of using Pydantic AI with Anthropic's Claude models to create structured outputs and AI agents.

The repository contains example implementations showing how to:

1. Extract structured data from natural language using Pydantic models
2. Create AI agents with tool-calling capabilities
3. Interact with Anthropic's Claude models programmatically

## Features

- **Structured AI Output**: Extract structured data (like city/country pairs) from natural language
- **AI Agents**: Example implementation of an AI agent for a simulated roulette game
- **Claude Integration**: Connect to Claude 3.5 Sonnet via the Anthropic API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- An Anthropic API key

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawndeggans/sanchos_irish_tacos.git
cd sanchos_irish_tacos
```

2. Set up a Python environment with devbox or your preferred tool
```bash
# If using devbox
devbox shell
```

3. Configure your environment
```bash
# Create a .env file with your Anthropic API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

4. Run the examples
```bash
python pydantic_model.py
python roulette_wheel.py
```

## Project Structure

- `pydantic_model.py` - Example of structured output extraction using Pydantic and Claude
- `anthropic_model_provider.py` - Helper module for connecting to Anthropic's API
- `roulette_wheel.py` - Example of an AI agent with tool-calling capabilities
- `main.py` - Simple entry point for the project

## Dependencies

- `pydantic-ai` - For creating structured AI interfaces
- `python-dotenv` - For environment variable management
- `logfire` - For optional logging and observability
- `jupyter` - For interactive development

## Development

This project uses:
- devbox for environment management
- Python 3.13
- uv for dependency management
